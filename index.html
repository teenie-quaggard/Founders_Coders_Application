    <p class="text" id="who-text">I am a 29-year-old Malay Filipino with a degree in sculpture. In 2012, I graduated from the Emily Carr University of Art and Design in beautiful British Columbia, Canada.
    <br>
    <br>
    Before moving to London, I lived in Berlin where I worked as the head assistant for an artist named <a href="http://www.andrearosengallery.com/artists/simon-fujiwara">Simon Fujiwara.</a> My job was to research, source and test materials, create artworks and manage the production of large scale exhibitions.
        <br>
        <br>
    After relocating to London, I felt a pull to direct my energy into something that felt more personally meaningful and I moved into the field of social support. For the past two years, I have been working as a tutor for children with disabilities while also facilitating community engagement projects for the <a href="https://www.mencap.org.uk/">disability charity Mencap.</a>
        <br>
        <br>
    In addition to my paid employment, I volunteer at <a href="https://switchboard.lgbt/">Switchboard,</a> the London-based LGBT+ helpline. The helpline is staffed exclusively by LGBT+ individuals who go through a rigorous 6 month training process. We talk about a range of issues including gender, identity, sexuality and mental health.

        <p id="why-text">While working at the charity, it was my responsibility to maintain a company blog so that the service users could keep up to date on the types of activities that we had running. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Although the blog was created as a sort of 'community newsletter' for the service users, the styling and accessibility features of the site were so outdated that many of the people I worked with could not navigate the webpage without help. I became interested in finding ways to fix this problem, but wasn't able to with my very limited knowledge of HTML. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The beauty of the world wide web is that it brings people together and spreads information quickly; but, like other public places, the internet needs to be a place that is accessible for many different types of users. I am interested in learning how to code so that I can help bridge a gap that seems to be widening faster than it is closing.

    <h2>What now?</h2>
    
    <p id="what-now">This is my first webpage and I realise that there is a lot of room for improvement. Moving forward, I am interested in becoming comfortable creating responsive webpages with accessible design and cleaner code. 
    <br><br>
    I am also extremely excited to explore the limits of Javascript.
